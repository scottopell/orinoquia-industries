orinoquia-industries
====================

This is a netlogo model of a remote region of Colombia called Orinoquia. The goal was to determine which of a set of industries would be best suited for the region, or if any at all were viable.

The basic idea of this model is that each industry runs its own simulations and then each turn reports back how well it did.
The system can plot this "success" and use it to determine the best allocation of resources, ie grant money.

This model was compiled by Jessika Officer, Scott Opell, Umi Scales and Jon Schoenwetter.
